Online Chat Messenger - Stage 2 Implementation

Description:
------------
In this stage, we have added the functionality for chat rooms. Clients can create their own chat rooms and other clients can join these rooms.

Features:
---------
1. Clients can create a chat room using the /create <room_name> command.
2. Clients can join an existing chat room using the /join <room_name> command.
3. Messages sent by a client will only be relayed to other clients in the same chat room.

Instructions to Run:
--------------------
1. Start the server by running the server script.
2. Start multiple clients by running the client script multiple times.
3. Use the /create and /join commands in the client to create and join chat rooms, respectively.

Note:
-----
This completes the implementation for Stage 2.
