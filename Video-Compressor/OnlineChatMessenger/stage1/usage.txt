Online Chat Messenger

Stage 1: Basic Implementation
-----------------------------

Running the Application:
1. Start the Server: Run the server script to initiate the server.
2. Start the Clients: Run the client script multiple times to simulate multiple client connections.

In this basic implementation for Stage 1:
- The server continuously listens for incoming messages.
- Upon receiving a message, the server relays it to all connected clients.
- The client can send messages to the server and also listens for incoming messages from other clients.

Future Stages
-------------

Stage 2 & Stage 3:

In the upcoming stages, the application will be enhanced with additional features:
- Chat Rooms: Clients will be able to create and join chat rooms.
- GUI Clients: A graphical user interface will be introduced for the client application.
- Multi-process Chat Rooms: The application will support multi-process chat rooms for improved performance and scalability.

Given the complexity and the extensive features planned for these stages, a detailed breakdown and a phased development approach will be adopted.
